Scrapes 2013 to 2022 Stack Overflow Survey Data and Visualizes using Chart.js

As programmers we must choose the right decisions when deciding between learning one technology over another. The easiest way to predict the future and longevity of a programming language is to simply analyze it's previous popularity, market share, and rating by developers, then make predictions based off these trends. This python script will go to each Stack Overflow Survey (SOS) from 2013 to 2022 and scrape meaningful data to find trends of developer technology.
